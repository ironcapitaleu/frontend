description: >
  Use when the user asks to "hand off", "create a handoff", "start a new agent session",
  "spin up a driver session", "compact this session for another agent", "leave a state-of-play
  note", or invokes `/handoff`. Compacts the current conversation into a self-contained handoff:
  a prompt for a fresh agent session, or a state-of-play note on the In Progress Linear ticket for
  a human takeover.

# Handoff Skill

## Purpose

Compact the current conversation into a **standalone session prompt**. A fresh agent session reads
only that prompt, so it must carry every fact the successor needs. The successor has none of this
session's context.

The same compacted content serves two destinations: a fresh agent session, or a state-of-play
comment on the Linear ticket for a human takeover. This skill writes the content and stops. It does
not spawn a session or take over a ticket itself.

## When to Use

- The user wants a fresh session to own a bounded task while this session continues or ends.
- A task is large enough to run on its own (drive a PR to green, run a migration, a long refactor).
- Work on an In Progress ticket pauses and a person or agent must resume it later.
- The user says "hand off", "start a new session for this", or invokes `/handoff`.

## Destinations

One compacted handoff, rendered for the reader that receives it:

- **A fresh agent session** — write the content as a second-person prompt to a temporary file. The
  caller feeds it to a session-spawning tool, or the user pastes it into a new session. Ephemeral.
- **A Linear ticket** — post the content as a state-of-play comment on the In Progress ticket. Use
  third-person status voice so a person can take over. Persistent. Delegate the comment shape to
  the `linear` skill. Do not copy its template here.

Produce either, or both, from the same content. If the destination is unclear, ask the user.

## When Not to Use

- To write project documentation — use the `documentation` skill.

## The Handoff Document

The output is one self-contained Markdown document. Write it in the second person for an agent
session, or in third-person status voice for a Linear comment. Use this template:

```markdown
# Mission

<One or two sentences. The exact outcome the new session must reach. From the user's argument.>

# Context

<What the repository is, the working branch, and where the work stands right now. Name the package
or module in scope.>

# Current State

- Done: <what already landed — commits, merged PRs, files written>
- In flight: <open branches, open PRs with numbers, tickets In Progress>
- Blocked / undecided: <anything waiting on a decision, and what would unblock it>

# Key Decisions

<Each decision the successor must respect, one line each, with a link to the ADR, design doc, or
ticket that records it. Reference — never restate the full content.>

# Artifacts

<Every artifact the successor needs, by path or URL, never duplicated:
- Linear tickets (STA-xxx + URL)
- PRs (owner/repo#number)
- branches (name)
- design docs / ADRs (repo path)>

# Suggested Skills

<The skills the successor must load for this task, for example `component-scaffold`, `design`,
`testing`, `documentation`, `linear`, `plain-english`. Name each and say when to use it.>

# Next Steps

1. <Ordered, concrete first action.>
2. <...>

# Guardrails

<The constraints the successor must hold: the branch it must push to, the AGENTS.md rules that
apply, and any "never" from this session. State each as `must` or `never`.>

# Reporting

<When and how to report back: report on completion or on a blocker it cannot resolve.>
```

## Procedure

1. **Read the argument.** If the user gave no focus, ask the user once. Ask what the next session
   will do. Ask whether it ends at a branch, a merged PR, or a report.
2. **Compile the document** from the conversation, following the template. Reference every artifact
   by path or URL. Do not paste file contents the successor can read itself.
3. **Redact secrets.** Remove API keys, tokens, passwords, and personal data. Reference the
   secret's location instead, never its value.
4. **Choose the destination** — a fresh agent session, a Linear note, or both (see Destinations).
5. **Deliver:**
   - **Agent session** — write the document to a temporary directory outside the repository, as
     `handoff-<short-slug>.md`. Do not commit it. The caller feeds it to a session-spawning tool, or
     the user pastes it into a new session.
   - **Linear note** — post the content as a state-of-play comment on the In Progress ticket through
     the `linear` skill, in status voice.

   This skill writes the handoff content. It does not spawn a session or take over the ticket
   itself.

## Critical Invariants

- **Self-contained.** The successor sees only this prompt. If a fact is not in it, the successor
  does not have it.
- **Reference, do not duplicate.** Link tickets, PRs, branches, and docs. Never copy their bodies.
- **Redact before writing.** No secret value reaches the document. This matters most for the Linear
  note, which persists and other people read.
- **Never in the repository.** The agent-session file goes to a temporary directory. The Linear note
  goes to the ticket. A handoff is not a committed design doc.
- **Plain English.** The `plain-english` skill applies. State the mission, the state, and the next
  steps as facts and instructions.

## Authoritative Sources

No external sources. This skill encodes internal procedure only.

## Self-Improvement

After a handoff where the successor missed context or the user corrected the shape:

1. Ask whether the fix belongs in this skill.
2. Add the confirmed pattern to the template or the procedure.

Common additions: a template section the successor needed, a guardrail that was easy to miss, a
skill the successor must load for a class of task.

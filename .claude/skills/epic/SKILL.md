# Epic Skill

## Purpose

An epic is a build too large for one ticket and too foggy to plan in full at the start. This skill
defines a new epic and refines it across its life.

The epic is a **Linear Project**. This skill works at the project level, not the ticket level. It
keeps the planning state in Linear and the deliverable artifacts in the repository.

Every project description, ticket, ledger entry, and design doc this skill writes is English text.
The `plain-english` skill applies to all of this text.

## The Split: Linear Plans, the Repo Holds Artifacts

- **Linear (the Project)** holds the plan: the description, the milestones, the fog log, and the
  decisions ledger. The ledger holds one-line entries that **link** to artifacts.
- **The repository** holds the living design of the code: design docs and mermaid diagrams (a
  `DESIGN.md` section, an in-repo design note, or a Storybook story), following `DOCUMENTATION.md`.
  These are version-controlled and live close to the code. Never use an external drawing tool (no
  Excalidraw, no Google Docs) for a living design.
- **Linear can hold research.** A SPIKE finding or an exploratory research note can live as a Linear
  document attached to the project, the way the reference epic does.

The ledger links an artifact wherever its home is. A design decision is done when its artifact is
committed to the repo and the ledger links it. A research finding is done when its document exists,
in the repo or in Linear, and the ledger links it.

## The Project Shape

Model the project on the team's reference epic in Linear (for example, the test-coverage
initiative). The Project description has these sections:

```markdown
## User Story

As a …,
I want …,
so that … .

## Description

The goal of this epic, in a few sentences.

## Notes

Domain context and standing preferences that steer decisions.

## Definition of Done

- [ ] <top-level outcome — one per milestone>
- [ ] …

## Open Questions (Fog)

Group the fog by artifact category: design documents, abstractions, implementations, tests,
dependencies.

- <an unknown not yet sharp enough to ticket>
- …

## Decisions Ledger

- <one-line decision> — <in-repo artifact path or URL> · <resolving ticket STA-xxx>
- …

## Related Artifacts

- <in-repo design docs, diagrams, stories, by path>

## Out of Scope

- <work ruled beyond the destination>
```

- **User Story**: put each clause on its own line — `As a …,` / `I want …,` / `so that … .`
- **Milestones**: one per Definition-of-Done top-level item, each with a target date.
- **Issues**: the tickets of the epic, created through the `linear` skill, each carrying its label
  and its `blockedBy` edges.

## The Fog Log

The fog log is the "Open Questions (Fog)" section. It lists unknowns that block the destination but
are too dim to phrase as a ticket.

**Fog-versus-ticket test:** if the question is sharp enough to state now, create a SPIKE or DESIGN
ticket for it and wire its blocking edge. If it is too dim to phrase precisely, keep it in the fog
log until it sharpens.

The **frontier** is the set of open, unblocked, unassigned issues. It shows what a session can take
next. Chart the fog breadth-first: surface the whole frontier before you study one thread in depth.

## Charting the Fog by Artifact

Chart the fog by the artifacts the epic must produce. After the destination, ask one question:
what artifacts do we build toward? Propose a first list. Refine it with the user.

Chart the fog in these categories:

- **Design documents** — the `DESIGN.md` sections, diagrams, and design notes that describe the UI
  and its behavior.
- **Abstractions** — the component APIs (props), hooks, types, and ports the code needs.
- **Implementations** — the concrete components, pages, and adapters that satisfy the abstractions.
- **Tests** — the unit tests, Storybook play tests, and fixtures.
- **Dependencies** — the npm packages and external services the epic adds.

Feature-specific artifacts refine these categories. For a multi-screen feature, the first question
is which screens and shared components it needs. Each screen or shared component is its own artifact,
and each becomes its own ticket.

Propose a first list per category. The user confirms or corrects it. An undecided artifact stays as
fog. A decided artifact becomes a ticket and a Definition-of-Done item.

## Milestones Follow the Artifacts

Milestones sequence the artifacts toward the destination. Once the artifact list is shared, propose
milestones as an ordered grouping of those artifacts. Anchor the final set to the destination.

For a multi-screen feature, the milestones follow the screens in order:

- Build the first screen and its shared components.
- Build the second screen and its transition from the first.
- Build the third screen and its transition from the second.
- Finalize the design docs and the flow.

Each milestone is a coherent increment the epic can reach and show. Propose the milestones. The user
confirms or corrects them.

## Tickets Follow the Milestones and the Fog

Tickets have two sources:

- A **milestone** breaks into the build tickets that reach it — FEATURE, FRONTEND, and
  IMPLEMENTATION tickets.
- The **fog** produces decision tickets — SPIKE and DESIGN — as an unknown sharpens.

When a milestone is the next to reach, break it into tickets. Do not break every milestone at the
start. A full upfront breakdown is a premature backlog. Cut the current milestone's tickets. Defer
the later milestones.

## Mode: Define

Use this mode to establish a new epic, or to expand a bare project. It sets the destination, the
artifacts, the milestones, and the first frontier of tickets.

1. **Gather the destination.** Use `AskUserQuestion` for the goal, the scope, and the out-of-scope
   boundary.
2. **Chart the artifact fog.** Propose the artifacts the epic must produce, by category (design
   documents, abstractions, implementations, tests, dependencies). Grill the user until the list is
   shared. For a multi-screen feature, ask which screens and shared components it needs first. For
   the UI and its behavior, use the `design` skill. For a new component's file set, use the
   `component-scaffold` skill.
3. **Write the Project.** Create or update the Linear Project with the description template above
   (`mcp__Linear__save_project`). State the destination in the User Story and the Description.
4. **Create milestones** from the artifacts, sequenced toward the destination (see "Milestones
   Follow the Artifacts"). Each milestone is one Definition-of-Done top-level item. Give each a
   target date (`mcp__Linear__save_milestone`).
5. **Seed the decisions ledger** with decisions already made. Each entry links its in-repo artifact
   and the ticket that resolved it.
6. **Seed the fog log** from the artifact categories. Apply the fog-versus-ticket test: create a
   SPIKE or DESIGN ticket for each sharp question now. Wire its blocking edge.
7. **Create the first design doc** in the repo (a `DESIGN.md` section or an in-repo design note with
   a mermaid diagram), following `DOCUMENTATION.md`. Link it under Related Artifacts.

## Mode: Refine

Use this mode to advance an existing epic as work proceeds.

1. **Load the Project** — its description, milestones, issues, fog log, and ledger.
2. **Take one frontier ticket.** The open, unblocked, and unassigned issues are takeable. Assign it
   to yourself. Then work it.
3. **When a decision resolves:** record its artifact. A design decision becomes a mermaid design
   doc or a `DESIGN.md` section committed to the repo. A research finding becomes a repo doc or a
   Linear document. Then add a one-line entry to the decisions ledger, linking the artifact and the
   ticket. Remove the matching item from the fog log. Check its Definition-of-Done item or milestone.
4. **When fog sharpens:** create the SPIKE or DESIGN ticket. Wire its blocking edge.
5. **When a milestone is next:** break it into its build tickets (FEATURE, FRONTEND, or
   IMPLEMENTATION). Wire their blocking edges.
6. **Update the plan.** Remove resolved items from the fog log. Add new decisions to the ledger.
   Set each milestone's progress to match the work done.

Resolve one decision per session. Re-examine the fog afterward. A decision can reshape it. Research
tickets are the exception. They can run in parallel.

## Critical Invariants

- **The living design lives in the repo.** Every design doc, diagram, and design note that describes
  the code is version-controlled in the repo, never in an external drawing tool. Research and SPIKE
  findings can live as Linear documents. The ledger links each artifact by its home.
- **The Project is the single map.** Do not create a separate map issue next to it.
- **One decision → one ticket → one artifact → one ledger entry.** A decision lives in exactly one
  place.
- **Plan versus build.** A decision produces a SPIKE or DESIGN ticket. The build produces a FEATURE,
  FRONTEND, or IMPLEMENTATION ticket.
- **Ticket Sizing applies.** Every ticket the epic spawns follows the `linear` skill's Ticket
  Sizing rule — one ticket, one reviewable PR.
- **One decision per session.** Resolve a single decision. Re-examine the fog before the next one.
  Research tickets can run in parallel.
- **Claim before work.** Assign a ticket to yourself before working it, so two sessions never take
  the same one.
- **Refer by name.** Name an issue or milestone by its title, not a bare id.

## Authoritative Sources

- `plain-english` skill — the wording of every description, ticket, ledger entry, and design doc this skill writes.
- `linear` skill — ticket templates, labels, and the Ticket Sizing rule.
- `AGENTS.md`, `DOCUMENTATION.md`, `DESIGN.md`, and `TESTING.md` — the conventions for in-repo design docs, diagrams, and tests.
- The team's test-coverage initiative project — the reference epic to model.

## Self-Improvement

After an epic session where the user corrected the shape or the workflow:

1. Ask whether the fix belongs in this skill.
2. Add the confirmed pattern to the project template or the mode steps.

Common additions: a description section that proved useful, a fog-log rule, a clearer boundary
between the plan in Linear and the artifacts in the repo.

# PR Iterate Skill

## Purpose

Drive a tight feedback loop on a PR until a fresh review returns nothing new, then notify the human.

**What "iterate" means.** To iterate on a PR is to request a review on the current head, address
every new finding, and request another review. Repeat until a review returns nothing new. Only then
notify the human. Escalate an ambiguous finding to the human as it arises. Do not wait on the
human to trigger each re-review — a fresh review after every push is part of the loop, not a
checkpoint.

The auto-review runs only on PR open or reopen, so a new push is not reviewed on its own. Each
round must request a fresh review with an `@claude review` comment that names the PR Review
Guidelines.

**When the PR opens with no review at all.** An open sometimes produces no run, and the cause is
unknown. Nothing recovers it by itself.

The auto-review fires on two `pull_request` types, `opened` and `reopened`. Neither fires twice by
itself. So if the open produces no workflow run, only a reopen starts the auto-review. A push does
not, because `synchronize` is not in the list. A comment starts a review through a different job,
which is what option 1 below uses.

`ci.yaml` behaves differently. It sets no type list, so it takes the default, which includes
`synchronize`. The PR's next push fires it, if the PR targets `dev` or `main`, the only bases
`ci.yaml`'s `branches:` filter allows. That is why CI can come back on a PR where the auto-review
never does.

Two ways to recover, in order:

1. **Post `@claude review`.** This starts the `claude` job through the `issue_comment` trigger, a
   separate path from the `pull_request` one that failed. It works no matter who opened the PR, and
   it is the same comment every iteration round uses. Name the PR Review Guidelines in it.
2. **Ask the human to close and reopen the PR.** This retries the same `pull_request` path through
   the `reopened` type. Closing a PR is visible to everyone watching it, so escalate rather than do
   it yourself.

Try option 1 first. If a second check still finds no run, or the run finishes without a review,
escalate option 2 and wait, unless the PR comes from a fork.

**Check for the run rather than waiting on a wake event, because a run that is never created sends
no event.** A run takes a moment to appear, so an empty first check has learned nothing. Check again
before calling it a failure. Once a run exists, wait for it as Step 7 does. A run that starts and
then fails is not a review.

**On a fork PR option 2 cannot work.** Check with `gh pr view --json isCrossRepository` in a local
session, or `mcp__github__pull_request_read` with method `get` in a remote one, comparing the head
repository to the base. A `pull_request` event raised from a fork gets no secrets, so a reopen
starts the job and it fails on the missing token, which looks like success to anyone watching for a
run to appear. Option 1 keeps its token, because `issue_comment` runs in the base repository. So on
a fork PR, do not escalate. If option 1 gives no review there, stop and tell the human, and say a
reopen cannot help.

If the reopen gives no review either, stop and tell the human the review cannot be started, rather
than repeating either step. **If you escalated a reopen and the human has not done it, the
procedure is waiting, not finished.** Say that instead, and name the reopen as the outstanding
action. If both paths fail, the cause lies outside the trigger configuration. Examples are a
disabled workflow, an expired token, or exhausted Actions minutes. A third attempt costs a round
and tests nothing new.

Never assume the review ran. Check the Checks tab, or ask for it: `gh pr checks` in a local session,
`mcp__github__pull_request_read` with method `get_check_runs` in a remote one. Both report a failed
run as well as a missing one, and both name a run that is still queued or running.

**Two environments.** In a local interactive session (terminal / IDE), use the `gh` CLI, and
`gh run watch` to wait for the review. In a remote session (for example, Claude Code Remote)
subscribed to the PR, use the GitHub MCP tools (`mcp__github__*`) instead of `gh`. Do not poll
with `sleep`. Request the review, end the turn, and let the re-review arrive as a PR-activity wake
event. Recovering an open that produced no run is the exception: a run that was never created sends
no event, so check for the run as the procedure above says.

## Branching Strategy

This repository uses a **two-branch flow**:

- Feature branches → PR into `dev`
- `dev` → PR into `main` (release)

When creating PRs, always target `dev` unless explicitly told otherwise.

## Philosophy

- **Autonomous on the obvious:** Implement feedback that is clearly correct (bugs, security
  issues, naming violations, missing error handling, style convention violations per AGENTS.md).
- **Escalate the ambiguous:** Anything subjective, architectural, or strategic goes to the human.
  Taste-based choices, scope decisions, and tradeoffs that could affect project direction.
- **Keep the human in the loop:** Always summarize what feedback was received, what was
  implemented (and why), and what needs human input — even for changes you made autonomously.
- **Proactive re-review:** After implementing a batch of changes, comment `@claude review the
  latest changes, applying the PR Review Guidelines in AGENTS.md` on the PR to trigger a new review
  cycle. The `claude` job has no review prompt of its own, so the comment carries the contract.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify the PR

If no PR number is provided, determine it from:
1. The current branch: `gh pr view --json number,url`
2. Ask the user if ambiguous

### Step 2: Fetch Review Comments

```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr_number}/comments --paginate
gh pr view {pr_number} --json reviews,comments
```

In a remote session, use `mcp__github__pull_request_read` with methods `get_reviews`,
`get_comments`, and `get_check_runs` instead of `gh`. Post the Step 6 comment with
`mcp__github__add_issue_comment`.

Categorize each comment:

| Category | Action | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Clearly valid** | Implement immediately | Bug fix, security issue, naming rule violation, missing test, style per AGENTS.md |
| **Ambiguous / subjective** | Escalate to human | Architecture choice, scope question, "maybe we should...", taste-based |
| **Already resolved** | Skip | Marked as resolved, outdated by subsequent commits |
| **Nitpick / trivial** | Implement if cheap, otherwise batch | Typo, minor formatting |

### Step 3: Implement Valid Feedback

For each clearly valid comment:
1. Make the code change
2. Track what was changed and why (mapping comment → change)

Group related changes into a single commit where possible.

### Step 4: Report to Human

Present a summary to the user:

```
## PR Feedback Summary

### Implemented (N changes):
- [file:line] Fixed X because reviewer flagged Y
- [file:line] Added error handling for Z

### Needs Your Input (N items):
- [file:line] Reviewer suggests refactoring to X pattern — this is an architectural choice.
  Options: (a) do it, (b) push back with reason, (c) defer to separate ticket
- [file:line] "Should we add caching here?" — scope decision

### Skipped (N items):
- [file:line] Already resolved in previous commit
```

Use `AskUserQuestion` for ambiguous items if there are 1-3 of them. If more, present
the list and ask the human to respond.

### Step 5: Commit and Push

After implementing changes (both autonomous and human-directed):

```bash
git add <specific files>
git commit -m "refactor: address PR review feedback

- Fix X (reviewer comment on file:line)
- Add Y (reviewer comment on file:line)
- ..."
git push
```

### Step 6: Request Re-Review

Comment on the PR to trigger a new Claude review:

```bash
gh pr comment {pr_number} --body "@claude review the latest changes, applying the PR Review Guidelines in AGENTS.md — I addressed the previous feedback"
```

### Step 7: Wait and Continue

After requesting the re-review, wait for it by the means the environment allows:

- **Local session:** use `gh run watch` in the background until the review workflow completes, then
  fetch the new findings.
- **Remote session subscribed to the PR:** end the turn. The re-review arrives as a PR-activity
  wake event. Do not poll with `sleep`. On the event, fetch the new findings. If no event arrives,
  check for the run rather than waiting further. A run that was never created sends none, and the
  recovery procedure in Purpose applies.

Then:

1. If new findings exist, return to Step 2.
2. If a review returns nothing new, or only approvals, notify the human: "The review is clean, the
   PR is ready to merge."

If the session is interrupted, re-invoke `/pr-iterate` to resume. The skill fetches the latest
findings and continues.

### Exit Conditions

Stop iterating when:
- The review returns clean (no new comments)
- All remaining comments are ambiguous/human-decision items (escalated)
- The human says to stop
- 3 iterations have passed without convergence (flag to human)

## Replying to Addressed Comments

When you implement feedback from a specific review comment, reply to confirm:

```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr_number}/comments/{comment_id}/replies \
  --method POST -f body="Implemented — see commit {sha}"
```

Note: GitHub's REST API does not support resolving threads — only the GraphQL
`resolvePullRequestReviewThread` mutation does. Posting a reply confirms the fix
but does not auto-resolve. Only reply to comments YOU addressed — never reply to
human-escalated items.

## Guardrails

- **Never force-push** during iteration
- **Never resolve a comment without implementing it** (or explicitly explaining why it was skipped)
- **Max 3 autonomous iterations** before consulting the human
- **Never change the PR scope** — if feedback suggests new features or large refactors, flag
  to the human as a potential follow-up ticket
- **Follow AGENTS.md** — all code changes must follow the project's development guidelines
- **Commit granularity:** One commit per iteration batch, not one commit per comment
- **PR target:** Always `dev` unless explicitly told otherwise

## Proactive Propagation

After a PR is merged, **proactively propagate** through the full chain:

1. **Feature branch → `dev`**: Once CI is green and review is clean, merge (or inform the human it's ready).
2. **`dev` → `main`**: Immediately after the feature PR merges into `dev` and `dev` is green, invoke the **`release`** skill (the `dev → main` promotion) rather than hand-rolling the release PR — it applies the merge-commit rule and the diverged-config guard. Do not squash a `dev → main` release.

Do not wait to be asked — the goal is to get changes from feature branch → dev → main as fast and cleanly as possible. If there are reasons NOT to propagate (e.g., dev has untested changes from other PRs, a release freeze is in effect), flag it to the human instead of silently stopping.

**Branch hygiene:** Always verify you are on the correct branch before making changes or pushing. Run `git branch --show-current` if uncertain. When iterating on a PR, check out the branch that the PR is on — not an unrelated branch.

**Branch cleanup:** Claude cannot delete branches from the remote environment (`git push --delete` → HTTP 403; no GitHub MCP delete-branch tool). A human deletes them. So after a feature PR merges into `dev`, name the merged branch and ask the human to delete it. The `release` skill's Step 9 also sweeps every merged feature branch and asks for a delete-and-confirm, so branches never pile up.

## Integration with CI

The skill works alongside the `claude.yaml` workflow:
- The workflow's `claude-auto-review` job reviews on PR open and reopen (`pull_request: [opened, reopened]`)
- The `claude` job handles `@claude` comments (triggered by `issue_comment: created`)
- When this skill posts `@claude review …`, it triggers the `claude` job (not `claude-auto-review`)
- Only `claude-auto-review` carries a review prompt. The `claude` job takes its prompt from the comment, so every request must name the PR Review Guidelines
- You can invoke this skill at any point to address unaddressed feedback

  This skill should be used when the user asks to "iterate on the PR", "handle PR feedback",
  "address review comments", "drive the PR loop", "implement PR review feedback", or wants
  to enter a tight iterate-on-PR-feedback workflow. It drives the cycle of: read review
  comments → implement valid feedback → inform the human → request re-review → repeat.

# PR Iterate Skill

## Purpose

Drive a tight feedback loop on a PR: read review comments, implement clearly valid feedback,
inform the human about changes made and ambiguous feedback, request a re-review, and repeat
until the PR is clean.

**Note:** This skill is designed for local interactive agent sessions (terminal / IDE),
not for GitHub Actions. Tools like `AskUserQuestion` and `gh run watch` rely on an interactive
environment.

## Branching Strategy

This repository uses a **two-branch flow**:

- Feature branches → PR into `dev`
- `dev` → PR into `main` (release)

When creating PRs, always target `dev` unless explicitly told otherwise.

## Philosophy

- **Autonomous on the obvious:** Implement feedback that is clearly correct (bugs, security
  issues, naming violations, missing error handling, style convention violations per AGENTS.md).
- **Escalate the ambiguous:** Anything subjective, architectural, or strategic goes to the human.
  Taste-based choices, scope decisions, and tradeoffs that could affect project direction.
- **Keep the human in the loop:** Always summarize what feedback was received, what was
  implemented (and why), and what needs human input — even for changes you made autonomously.
- **Proactive re-review:** After implementing a batch of changes, comment `@claude review the
  latest changes` on the PR to trigger a new review cycle.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify the PR

If no PR number is provided, determine it from:
1. The current branch: `gh pr view --json number,url`
2. Ask the user if ambiguous

### Step 2: Fetch Review Comments

```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr_number}/comments --paginate
gh pr view {pr_number} --json reviews,comments
```

Categorize each comment:

| Category | Action | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Clearly valid** | Implement immediately | Bug fix, security issue, naming rule violation, missing test, style per AGENTS.md |
| **Ambiguous / subjective** | Escalate to human | Architecture choice, scope question, "maybe we should...", taste-based |
| **Already resolved** | Skip | Marked as resolved, outdated by subsequent commits |
| **Nitpick / trivial** | Implement if cheap, otherwise batch | Typo, minor formatting |

### Step 3: Implement Valid Feedback

For each clearly valid comment:
1. Make the code change
2. Track what was changed and why (mapping comment → change)

Group related changes into a single commit where possible.

### Step 4: Report to Human

Present a summary to the user:

```
## PR Feedback Summary

### Implemented (N changes):
- [file:line] Fixed X because reviewer flagged Y
- [file:line] Added error handling for Z

### Needs Your Input (N items):
- [file:line] Reviewer suggests refactoring to X pattern — this is an architectural choice.
  Options: (a) do it, (b) push back with reason, (c) defer to separate ticket
- [file:line] "Should we add caching here?" — scope decision

### Skipped (N items):
- [file:line] Already resolved in previous commit
```

Use `AskUserQuestion` for ambiguous items if there are 1-3 of them. If more, present
the list and ask the human to respond.

### Step 5: Commit and Push

After implementing changes (both autonomous and human-directed):

```bash
git add <specific files>
git commit -m "refactor: address PR review feedback

- Fix X (reviewer comment on file:line)
- Add Y (reviewer comment on file:line)
- ..."
git push
```

### Step 6: Request Re-Review

Comment on the PR to trigger a new Claude review:

```bash
gh pr comment {pr_number} --body "@claude review the latest changes — I addressed the previous feedback"
```

### Step 7: Wait and Continue (if in local terminal)

After requesting re-review:
1. Use `gh run watch` (in background) to wait for the review workflow to complete
2. Once complete, fetch new comments
3. If new feedback exists, go back to Step 2
4. If no new feedback or only approvals, report to the human: "PR is clean, ready to merge"

Note: This wait-and-continue loop only works in a local interactive Claude Code session.
If the session is interrupted, the user can re-invoke `/pr-iterate` to pick up where
the loop left off — the skill will fetch the latest comments and continue from there.

### Exit Conditions

Stop iterating when:
- The review comes back clean (no new comments)
- All remaining comments are ambiguous/human-decision items (escalated)
- The human says to stop
- 3 iterations have passed without convergence (flag to human)

## Replying to Addressed Comments

When you implement feedback from a specific review comment, reply to confirm:

```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr_number}/comments/{comment_id}/replies \
  --method POST -f body="Implemented — see commit {sha}"
```

Note: GitHub's REST API does not support resolving threads — only the GraphQL
`resolvePullRequestReviewThread` mutation does. Posting a reply confirms the fix
but does not auto-resolve. Only reply to comments YOU addressed — never reply to
human-escalated items.

## Guardrails

- **Never force-push** during iteration
- **Never resolve a comment without implementing it** (or explicitly explaining why it was skipped)
- **Max 3 autonomous iterations** before checking in with the human
- **Never change the PR scope** — if feedback suggests new features or large refactors, flag
  to the human as a potential follow-up ticket
- **Follow AGENTS.md** — all code changes must follow the project's development guidelines
- **Commit granularity:** One commit per iteration batch, not one commit per comment
- **PR target:** Always `dev` unless explicitly told otherwise

## Proactive Propagation

After a PR is merged, **proactively propagate** through the full chain:

1. **Feature branch → `dev`**: Once CI is green and review is clean, merge (or inform the human it's ready).
2. **`dev` → `main`**: Immediately after the feature PR merges into `dev`, create a PR from `dev` to `main` so the release path stays unblocked.

Do not wait to be asked — the goal is to get changes from feature branch → dev → main as fast and cleanly as possible. If there are reasons NOT to propagate (e.g., dev has untested changes from other PRs, a release freeze is in effect), flag it to the human instead of silently stopping.

**Branch hygiene:** Always verify you are on the correct branch before making changes or pushing. Run `git branch --show-current` if uncertain. When iterating on a PR, check out the branch that the PR is on — not an unrelated branch.

## Example Invocation

User: "iterate on the PR"
→ Skill fetches PR #111's review comments
→ Implements 3 clearly valid fixes
→ Asks human about 1 architectural question
→ Commits, pushes, comments `@claude review the latest changes`
→ Waits for new review
→ Reports: "New review is clean. PR ready to merge into dev."
→ After merge to dev, creates PR from dev → main

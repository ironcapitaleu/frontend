# Linear Issue Management Skill

## Purpose

Create, read, update, and search Linear issues for the State-machine team. All issues follow
a consistent template structure with typed labels, user stories, and definition-of-done checklists.

## Team & Workspace

- **Team:** State-machine
- **Team ID:** `2f641ff7-6c29-4aa7-9bc5-659ff838e4ad`
- **Team Key:** STA

## Issue Type Philosophy

Each issue type exists for a specific reason in the development workflow:

| Type | Purpose | Preconditions | Outputs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **SPIKE** | Reduce ambiguity. Research a topic so that a later implementation ticket can be written with clear, concrete requirements. | Unclear requirements, multiple possible approaches, or unfamiliar technology. | A findings document linked in the ticket. A recommendation for how to proceed. |
| **FEATURE** | Implement new functionality. Requirements should already be reasonably clear (often from a preceding SPIKE). | Clear acceptance criteria. Design docs or SPIKE findings available. | Working code, tests, PR merged. |
| **REFACTOR** | Restructure existing code without changing external behavior. | Code works but is hard to maintain, extend, or understand. | Same behavior, better structure. |
| **IMPLEMENTATION** | General implementation that doesn't fit FEATURE (e.g., wiring, integration, infra). | Requirements known. | Working code, tests, PR merged. |
| **ONBOARDING** | Structured learning path for team members to get productive. | New team member or new technology area. | Completed reading/exercises. |
| **DOCS** | Improve documentation quality and consistency. | Docs are missing, outdated, or inconsistent. | Updated documentation. |
| **TEST** | Add or review test coverage. | Code exists but tests are missing or inadequate. | Test suite improvements. |
| **FRONTEND** | UI/frontend implementation or changes. | Design or requirements available. | Working UI, tests, PR merged. |
| **DATABASE** | Data layer work: schemas, migrations, queries, storage design, database infrastructure. | Data model or storage requirements known. | Schema/migration/query changes, tests, PR merged. |
| **DESIGN** | Architectural/design work producing diagrams or specs. | System needs to be designed before implementation. | Design documents, diagrams. |

### The SPIKE → FEATURE Pipeline

SPIKEs exist to **de-risk** implementation. The pattern is:

1. **SPIKE** — research, compare approaches, write findings, make a recommendation
2. **FEATURE** — implement the recommendation with clear acceptance criteria

SPIKEs always link to their related implementation ticket. FEATURE tickets that were preceded
by a SPIKE link back to it for context.

## Issue Types (Labels)

| Label | Title Prefix | Priority (typical) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| FEATURE | `[FEATURE]` | High (2) |
| SPIKE | `[SPIKE]` | High (2) |
| REFACTOR | `[REFACTOR]` | Medium (3) |
| IMPLEMENTATION | `[IMPLEMENTATION]` | High (2) |
| ONBOARDING | `[ONBOARDING]` | High (2) |
| DOCS | `[DOCS]` | High (2) or Medium (3) |
| TEST | `[TEST]` | Medium (3) |
| FRONTEND | `[FRONTEND]` | Medium (3) |
| DATABASE | `[DATABASE]` | High (2) |
| DESIGN | `[DESIGN]` | High (2) |
| (none) | (no prefix) | Varies |

### Priority Scale

| Value | Label | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Urgent | Blocking other work, needs immediate attention |
| 2 | High | Important, on the critical path, default for most tickets |
| 3 | Medium | Should be done but not blocking, backlog-worthy |
| 4 | Low | Nice to have, do when time permits |

## Title Format

Titles follow: `[PREFIX] Descriptive Title`

Use backtick-quoted code names where appropriate:

    [FEATURE] `StockScreener` filter by market cap
    [SPIKE] Design authentication flow with Supabase
    [DOCS] Documentation Consistency
    [FRONTEND] Responsive layout for `ContactPage`

**Exception:** Basic user tickets have NO prefix — just the descriptive title.

## Few-Shot Examples

### Example 1: SPIKE (STA-124)

**Title:** ``[SPIKE] Design a Rate Limiter for `Extract` `SuperState` ``
**Priority:** High (2)
**Label:** SPIKE

```markdown
## **User Story:**

As a developer,

I want to make sure that I have configurable global rate limiting across `StateMachine` runs

so that I can run ingestion pipelines at maximum throughput.

## **Description:**

This SPIKE ticket is related to the implementation ticket [STA-125](https://linear.app/state-machine/issue/STA-125/feature-implement-controllable-rate-limiting-for-extract-superstate).

## Definition of Done:

- [ ] Review how to best implement a Rate Limiter for our State Machine Executions
  - [ ] Review if and what libraries are needed for this
    - [ ] Is there a built-in `tokio` rate limiter, is it usable for us?
    - [ ] governor - not sure if this will do it instead?
  - [ ] how would they be best integrated into our existing async stream pipeline?
    - [ ] minimal disruptions to the async stream would be ideal
  - [ ] how and where would the rate limiter be initialized?
  - [ ] How about a Queue-based rate limiter, like the token bucket vs leaky bucket?
    - [ ] Compare the two and when each is preferred, and what you would suggest for our use case
- [ ] Review also how to best test the rate limiter
  - [ ] e.g., via timed integration tests or whatnot
- [ ] Also note or review limitations of this rate limiting strategy and how it could be implemented in a distributed fashion
- [ ] Does it make sense to remove `buffer_unordered(3)` once we have the rate limiter?
- [ ] Write a document (e.g., Linear document) containing the findings of this research.
  - [ ] Summarize these review findings and discuss potential alternatives (if they exist) on a very high level. Discuss pros and cons for each approach.
  - [ ] Based on the summary, make a recommendation as to how rate limiting should ideally be implemented with minimal disruptions to our async stream implementations for the ETL pipeline
  - [ ] Link the created written document in the "Link to Findings" section in this ticket

### Example 2: FEATURE (STA-74)

**Title:** ``[FEATURE] `ExecuteSecRequest` as Third Sub-`State` of `Extract` ``
**Priority:** High (2)
**Label:** FEATURE

```markdown
## **User Story:**

As a developer,

I want to implement the `ExecuteSecRequest` `State` of the `Extract` `SuperState`

so that I can continue working on the other Sub-`States` of the `Extract` `SuperState` in the ETL pipeline.

## **Description:**

This is the implementation of the Sub-`State` in the `Extract` `SuperState` that sends the actual request with the `Cik` to the SEC server and gets the company information returned.

Validation of only that the request has been successful will be made at this point. No validation about the structure of the data (?).

## Definition of Done:

- [ ] `ExecuteSecRequest` Sub-`State` implemented
  - [ ] Implement the third Sub-`State` of the `Extract` `SuperState`
  - [ ] Design an `ExecuteSecRequest` as a `State` for the `Extract` `StateMachine`
  - [ ] Implement the `ExecuteSecRequest` `State` according to the Retrieval State design doc
  - [ ] Implement the necessary domain concepts (if needed) inside the `arkad/sec/src/lib/shared/` directory
  - [ ] Implement Error Handling for the `ExecuteSecRequest` `State` according to the existing hybrid error handling model
  - [ ] (If applicable) Adapt the `Extract` `SuperState` and the `main()` function
- [ ] Follow the Software Development Guidelines outlined in [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md)

## **Related Design Documents:**

Error Handling: `arkad/sec/design/uml_class_diagram/sec_error_handling.md`

Class diagram (update `StateError` here): `arkad/sec/design/uml_class_diagram/sec_sample_state.md`

State diagram: `arkad/sec/design/state_diagram/sec_state_machine.md`

## **Additional Notes:**

Once this is done, a `Transition` from `Extract<PrepareSecRequest>` to `Extract<ProcessSecRequest>` can be implemented.

---
```

### Example 3: FEATURE — Transition (STA-73)

**Title:** ``[FEATURE] `Transition` from `Extract<ValidateCikFormat>` to `Extract<PrepareSecRequest>` ``
**Priority:** High (2)
**Label:** FEATURE

```markdown
## **User Story:**

As a developer

I want to implement the `Transition` from `ValidateCikFormat` to the `PrepareSecRequest` `State` of the `Extract` `SuperState`

so that I can continue working on the other Sub-`States` of the `Extract` `SuperState` in the ETL pipeline and have a first `Transition` implementation as a baseline for future implementations.

## **Description:**

Implement the `Transition` from `ValidateCikFormat` to `PrepareSecRequest`.

Implement any fixtures if needed.

Implement a first `TransitionError`.

This ticket is a direct continuation of [STA-72](https://linear.app/state-machine/issue/STA-72/feature-preparesecrequestas-second-sub-state-of-extract).

## Definition of Done:

- [ ] `Transition` from the `ValidateCikFormat` to the `PrepareSecRequest` is implemented
  - [ ] `Transition` trait with its methods has been implemented from `ValidateCikFormat` to `PrepareSecRequest`
  - [ ] Implement the necessary domain concepts (if needed) inside the `arkad/sec/src/lib/shared/` directory
  - [ ] Implement Error Handling for the `Transition` according to the existing hybrid error handling model (add/use a `Transition` error)
  - [ ] the main method inside the binary now initializes a `StateMachine` in the `Extract<ValidateCikFormat>` `State` and transfers to `Extract<PrepareSecRequest>` `State` - the logging statements have been adapted
- [ ] Follow the Software Development Guidelines outlined in [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md)

## **Related Design Documents:**

Error Handling: `arkad/sec/design/uml_class_diagram/sec_error_handling.md`

State diagram: `arkad/sec/design/state_diagram/sec_state_machine.md`

## **Additional Notes:**

Once this is done, a `Transition` from `Extract<PrepareSecRequest>` to `Extract<ExecuteSecRequest>` can be implemented.

```

### Example 4: REFACTOR (STA-90)

**Title:** ``[REFACTOR] `Extract` with Sub-`States` ``
**Priority:** Medium (3)
**Label:** REFACTOR

```markdown
## **User Story:**

As a developer,

I want to be able to ergonomically use `Extract` with all its Sub-`State`s

so that I can use and modify the `Extract` `State` easily.

## **Description:**

This is a refactoring ticket to finalize the implementation work of working on the `Extract` `SuperState` with all its Sub-States.

## Definition of Done:

- [ ] Review the code with respect to (but not limited to) the following aspects. Refactor them if any of these things apply.
  - [ ] Folder Structure and Naming

## Building the Definition of Done

The Definition of Done is the most critical part of every ticket — it defines when work
is complete and prevents scope ambiguity. Every Definition of Done should be constructed deliberately using
the following methodology.

### Structure Rules

1. **Two levels of nesting:** Top-level checkboxes are major deliverables or work areas.
   Nested checkboxes are specific, actionable tasks within that deliverable.
2. **Actionable items only:** Each checkbox should describe a concrete action or artifact,
   not a vague aspiration. "Implement error handling" → good. "Think about errors" → bad.
3. **Ordered by execution flow:** Items should roughly follow the order in which they'd be
   completed. Research before implementation, implementation before testing.
4. **Final item is always the guidelines link** (for FEATURE, REFACTOR, IMPLEMENTATION types).

### Per-Type Definition of Done Patterns

| Type | Definition of Done Structure |
| --- | --- |
| **SPIKE** | Research areas (with specific questions as sub-items) → Testing/validation considerations → Write findings doc (with sub-items: summarize, recommend, link) |
| **FEATURE** | Primary implementation (with sub-tasks: design, implement, domain concepts, error handling, integration) → Guidelines link |
| **REFACTOR** | Review aspects as top-level items (with specific checks as sub-items) → Guidelines link |
| **IMPLEMENTATION** | Same as FEATURE |
| **ONBOARDING** | Resources grouped by source (book chapters, exercises, notes) with individual items as sub-checkboxes |
| **DOCS / TEST / FRONTEND / DATABASE / DESIGN** | Deliverables specific to the work, no fixed pattern |

### How to Build the Definition of Done Interactively

Building the Definition of Done is a natural end point of the guided flow: after system area, issue type,
title, and user story are settled, converge on the Definition of Done together with the user.

**Propose-then-refine (default):** When you can think of Definition of Done items — from the problem
description, conversation context, or domain knowledge — draft a full list of proposed
items and present it to the user for refinement *before* creating the ticket. Ask what
to add, remove, or sharpen. Iterate until the user is satisfied, then create the ticket
with the refined Definition of Done.

**Ideate together (fallback):** When you cannot propose meaningful items, don't present
an empty or generic list — ideate with the user directly. Use `AskUserQuestion` to clarify:

1. **What are the major deliverables?** — These become top-level checkboxes.
2. **What specific sub-tasks does each deliverable involve?** — These become nested checkboxes.
3. **Are there specific questions to answer or alternatives to compare?** (SPIKEs)
4. **Are there specific components or pages affected?** (FEATURE/FRONTEND/REFACTOR)
5. **What does "done" look like — how would you verify this is complete?**

### Definition of Done Quality Checklist (internal, not shown to user)

Before finalizing a Definition of Done, verify:

- [ ] Every top-level item is independently verifiable (someone can check it off without ambiguity)
- [ ] Sub-items are specific enough that two developers would interpret them the same way
- [ ] No item duplicates what's already in the Description section
- [ ] SPIKE Definitions of Done end with the "Write a document" item and its standard sub-items
- [ ] FEATURE/REFACTOR/IMPLEMENTATION Definitions of Done end with the guidelines link (correct phrasing per type)
- [ ] Items reference specific code names in backticks where applicable

## Workflow: Creating an Issue

### Step 1: Gather Information

Guide the user from high-level to specific. Use `AskUserQuestion` to collect:

1. **System area** (only if not clear from the conversation/prompt) — which part of the
   system is this ticket about? Options: **Backend** (pipeline, state machine, crates),
   **Frontend** (UI, pages, components), **Database** (data layer: schemas, migrations,
   queries, storage), **Cross-cutting** (docs, CI/CD, onboarding, process). Skip this
   question entirely when the area is obvious from context — it exists to orient the
   conversation, not to add friction.
2. **Issue type** — options: FEATURE, SPIKE, REFACTOR, IMPLEMENTATION, ONBOARDING, DOCS, TEST, FRONTEND, DATABASE, DESIGN, Basic (no prefix).
   Use the system area to narrow the options offered:
   - **Frontend** → FRONTEND (or SPIKE/REFACTOR/TEST if the work is research, restructuring, or testing)
   - **Database** → DATABASE (or SPIKE/DESIGN for research and schema-design work)
   - **Backend** → FEATURE, IMPLEMENTATION, REFACTOR, SPIKE, TEST, DESIGN
   - **Cross-cutting** → DOCS, ONBOARDING, or Basic
3. **Title** — what is this issue about? (will be formatted as `[TYPE] Title`, or just `Title` for basic)
4. **User story** — what do you want and why?
5. **Priority** — options: Urgent (1), High (2), Medium (3), Low (4) — default High (2)

If the user provided enough context when invoking the skill, skip questions you can already
answer. Infer what you can from conversation context.

### Step 2: Build the Description and Definition of Done

Based on the issue type, fill in the appropriate template. The Definition of Done is the most important
part — follow the "Building the Definition of Done" section above to construct it.

**Gathering Definition of Done input:**

- If the user provided rich context (problem description, specific concerns, components involved),
  draft the full Definition of Done from that context, propose it to the user, and refine it with their
  feedback before creating the ticket (see "How to Build the Definition of Done Interactively" above).
- If context is sparse, ideate with the user via targeted follow-up questions instead of
  proposing a generic list.
- Always err on the side of being specific — a Definition of Done that's too detailed is better than one that's too vague.

**Additional template-specific questions:**

- **FEATURE:** What are the acceptance criteria? Related design docs? Is there a preceding SPIKE?
- **SPIKE:** What is the related implementation ticket? What specific research questions need answering? What alternatives should be compared?
- **ONBOARDING:** What resources should be read? What's the learning path? What's the continuation of?
- **REFACTOR:** What is being refactored and why? What aspects should be reviewed?

### Step 3: Create the Issue

Use `mcp__linear__create_issue` with:
- `teamId`: `2f641ff7-6c29-4aa7-9bc5-659ff838e4ad`
- `title`: formatted as `[LABEL] Title` (or just `Title` for basic)
- `description`: filled template
- `priority`: user-selected (default 2)
- `labelIds`: match the label to existing IDs (see Label IDs section). Omit if the label ID is not yet captured.

### Step 4: Confirm

Show the user the created issue URL and summary.

## Workflow: Reading / Searching Issues

- **List issues:** Use `mcp__linear__list_issues` with team filter
- **Search:** Use `mcp__linear__search_issues` with keywords
- **Get details:** Use `mcp__linear__get_issue` with the issue ID
- **List teams:** Use `mcp__linear__list_teams` to discover team IDs when needed
- **List projects:** Use `mcp__linear__list_projects` to discover project IDs for filtering

When presenting issues to the user, show: identifier, title, status, assignee, and URL.

## Workflow: Updating an Issue

Use `mcp__linear__update_issue` to change status, assignee, priority, or description.
Always confirm with the user before making changes.

## Label IDs

| Label | ID |

## Conventions

- **SPIKE before FEATURE (when needed):** When requirements are unclear or multiple approaches exist, create a SPIKE before the FEATURE. Not every FEATURE needs a SPIKE — only those with ambiguity that needs resolving. When a SPIKE exists, link it bidirectionally with its FEATURE.
- **Implementation requires clarity:** FEATURE and IMPLEMENTATION tickets should have concise requirements or designs in place before work begins. If requirements are unclear, create a SPIKE first.
- **Comments as progress logs:** Use comments for meeting notes (DONE / NEXT STEPS format) and progress updates.
- **Branch names:** Linear auto-generates branch names from titles — no manual naming needed.
- **Due dates:** Set when known, especially for SPIKEs.
- **Related tickets:** Always cross-reference related issues with `[STA-XXX](url)` format.
- **Continuation chains:** ONBOARDING and sequential FEATURE tickets reference their predecessor as "direct continuation of [STA-XXX]".
- **Empty fields:** Use `/` for sections with no content (Description, Related Design Documents, Additional Notes, Link to Findings).
- **Software Development Guidelines:** FEATURE, REFACTOR, and IMPLEMENTATION tickets always include the guidelines link in Definition of Done. Each uses slightly different phrasing — follow the template exactly:
  - FEATURE: "The Software Development Guidelines outlined in [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) are followed"
  - REFACTOR: "Make sure the Software Development Guidelines outlined in [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) are followed"
  - IMPLEMENTATION: "Follow the Software Development Guidelines outlined in [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md)"
- **Definition of Done structure:** See the dedicated "Building the Definition of Done" section above for the full methodology. In short: top-level items are major deliverables, nested items are specific tasks, ordered by execution flow.
- **Next steps in Additional Notes:** When a ticket enables follow-on work, note it (e.g., "Once this is done, a `Transition` from X to Y can be implemented.").

## Self-Improvement

After creating an issue where the user corrected or refined the template, naming, or workflow:

1. Ask: "Should I update the linear skill with this change?"
2. If yes, update the relevant section in this SKILL.md.
3. Apply after user approval.

Examples of things worth capturing:
- New issue types or labels that emerge (add to the tables and create a template if warranted)
- Template adjustments (new sections, reworded headings, different Definition of Done phrasing)
- New label IDs discovered when creating issues of previously-uncaptured types
- Priority conventions that differ from the documented defaults
- Workflow changes (e.g., new linking conventions, new fields to fill)
- Few-shot examples that better represent current practice — replace outdated ones
- Conventions the user establishes through repeated corrections

Nothing in this skill is set in stone — templates, headings, types, and conventions should
evolve as the team's process evolves. The skill is authoritative guidance, not a frozen spec.
